- 👋 Hi, I’m @crydtobo
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, especially in C++ and Python. I am solving tasks from HTB, CryptoHack as well as CTFs.
- 🌱 I'm currently traveling through the world of CyberSecurity, AI and Programming. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on App intersting projects thanks to which I will develop my both hard and soft skills ;)
- 📫 How to reach me -> my linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawid-widomski

At present I have three repositories. One of them consist tasks from cryptohack (only a few, maybe it will make more avaiable in the future )  ;)
second -> tasks from Advent of Code 2020
third  -> coding game tasks
Enjoy
  David
