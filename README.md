- 👋 Hi, I’m @crydtobo
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, especially in C++. Sometimes I am solving tasks from Cryptohack, its funny and enjoyable platform to develop cryptology and security skills. 
Also CodingGame is additctive platform to solve programming problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and OpenGL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++, intersting problems thanks to which I will develop my both hard and soft skills ;)

At present I have three repositories. One of them consist tasks from cryptohack (only a few, maybe it will make more avaiable in the future )  ;)
second -> tasks from Advent of Code 2020
third  -> coding game tasks
Enjoy
